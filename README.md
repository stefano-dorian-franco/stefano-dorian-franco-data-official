  <h1>Stefano Dorian FRANCO</h1>

  <p><em>(Stefano Dorian Franco-Bora, degli Franchi da Ceva ed La Briga, in original complete Italian-Piemontese dialect)</em></p>

  <p>Born on September 9, 1973, in Paris, of Italian Piemontese &amp; French descent.</p>

  <p>Parisian Author and multidisciplinary Cultural creator. Independent Researcher.</p>

  <p>Voluntarily self-taught education. Chose to leave the school system and request legal emancipation at the age of 16 in 1989, in order to travel and learn about life through real experiences.</p>

  <p>Active internationally since his beginnings at the age of 19 (under the Alias: Allen Katona) for a "trilogy of war reports" across 3 continents: Europe, the Middle East, and Asia: 1992, siege of Sarajevo, during the Balkan Wars in Eastern Europe following the fall of the Berlin Wall.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29631338.v1">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29631338.v1</a> ; 1993 Lebanon civil war, a conflict spanning over two decades, pitting different factions against each other in inter-confessional geopolitical mechanisms: <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29632538.v1">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29632538.v1</a> ; 1995 Cambodia civil war, a civil war that also began in the 70s and persisted into the 90s in the form of jungle guerrilla warfare:  <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29650133.v1">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29650133.v1</a> . After this learning cycle on the subject of the human being facing war, transition to a 5-year cycle in India and Nepal under 3 very different thematic angles: the study of Hindu and Buddhist mystics, earth-sea-mountain extreme sports, and the organization of a humanitarian aid structure for children in the Kathmandu Valley. This 90s decade on these two fields was recognized by: the ENAC International Reporting Award by the Ecole Nationale des Mines in 1993 for the report on Lebanon, and the National Laureate Award Défi Jeunes Initiatives for those under 26 in 1998 by the French Ministry of Youth and Sports.    </p>

  <p>This decade of the 90s spent in field action and strongly oriented towards ethnographic exploration led to an evolution in the transition to the 2000s: the concept of developing a body of work based on the principle of "transversal multidisciplinarity" by interconnecting different registers, as the exploration of various genres unfolded... by crossing Reportages, narrative writing, ethnographic explorations, literature, plural contemporary arts, multimedia concepts, live happenings, digital art extended universes by AI piloting, international diplomatic mediation.</p>

  <p>Sprit: Develops a body of work based on a transversal conceptual approach, aiming to explore and remix various fields of cultural creation in a multidimensional way, constantly crossing and shifting from one genre to another — a method that constitutes his distinctive signature.</p>

  <p>Style: Deliberately avoids mainstream recognition and chooses not to appear in mass media, social networks, show business, or marketing campaigns, in order to focus attention not on his personality but on his creations and the meanings conveyed by the works themselves.</p>

  <p>Ethic: A special emphasis is placed on the commitment to sharing culture (CC Creative Commons position) in order to ensure inclusive accessibility for the widest possible audience. </p>

  ## 1990's Initiatory years in extreme fields of experiences as school of life

  <p>He began his adult life by deciding to obtain legal emancipation in order to reach the age of majority at 16 in 1989. He left Paris and permanently withdrew from the school system to pursue a self-taught path of learning through life experience. For two years, he traveled backpacking across Europe. For greater discretion, he took the pseudonym "Allen Katona" which he kept from the age of 16 in 1989 until he was 30 in 2003.</p>

  <p>He reappeared in Paris in early 1992, independently entering, like a Parisian-Gavroche, the cultural and artistic world of the Left Bank artists’ studios in Montparnasse and Quartier latin. Eager to learn further through more extreme experiences, he once again left Paris to embark on another path.</p>

  <p>He began his pro career, as freelance, in the 1990s at the age of 19, in 1992, under the pseudonym Allen Katona, as a war correspondent during the siege of Sarajevo, covering the Balkan War that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of Eastern Europe. Accredited by the Press Office of the UNPROFOR (United Nations Protection Force) with Press Card No. 5889, he published his war report in the magazine Convergence.</p>

  <p>The following year, in 1993, he carried out a hard-hitting war report in Beirut and southern Lebanon, focusing on the emergency humanitarian work of NGOs assisting civilians trapped amid the multiple armed conflicts between the region’s various factions. This uncompromising field immersion earned him the ENAC Award (École des Mines) for International Sociological Reporting.</p>

  <p>He completed his “War Trilogy” in 1995 with a nine-month mission in Cambodia’s jungles alongside the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC), documenting landmine clearance operations serving displaced civilian populations. This work became part of the UNESCO Photographic Archive for its international anti-landmine awareness campaigns.</p>

  <p>After a first spell in 1994, from 1996 to 2001, he was based for 6 years in India and Nepal, where he maintained a dual activity: instructor in extreme land–air–sea sports (scuba diving, rafting, climbing) for Western expeditions operating in the region; and founder of the humanitarian association ASEI (Action Solidarité Enfance Internationale), providing medical and educational aid to orphaned children in isolated villages encountered during his expeditions.</p>

  <p>In 1996-1997, he broadened his scope through a six-month ethnographic exploration in the sacred city of Hinduism, Varanasi/Benares, in India. There, he studied the metaphysical conceptual framework of Hinduism, the cults of Shiva and Kali, and wrote an ethnographic and anthropological travel diary, later published as the book Voir l’aube à Bénarès / Dawn in Benares (ISBN 2-912217-00-8). In 1999, he turned to Buddhism in Nepal, engaged with the Tibetan exile community, and wrote a series of travel articles that were published weekly in the local newspaper The Kathmandu Post.</p>

  <p>In 1998-1999, he was awarded the “Défi Jeunes Initiatives” Prize, International Solidarity category, by the French Government (Ministry of Youth and Sports / Ministry of Foreign Affairs).</p>

  <p>In his final two years in Asia, he broadened his scope to the theme of “Security in Red Zone Expatriation” and became a security consultant for embassies, corporations, emergency procedures for insurance companies to repatriate Westerners in critical situations back to Europe.</p>

  <p>In 2000, he contributed as a resource expert on extreme-zone security to the book Solidarité Internationale by S. Mariaccia (Éditions Dakota). ISBN:‎ 978-2910932497. The implementation of these security protocols in ultra-sensitive areas of India and Asia are the last remnants of an era: the late 1990s and the end of the twentieth century, a time when at best there was only the fax, since the internet was just beginning and remained inaccessible, just like GSM mobile phone networks. An era with no GPS for routing-guidance and no AI for Q&amp;A. When one had to be able to adapt and survive in sometimes hostile environments without the help of any technology, relying only on instinct, situations-reading and skills, in a “completely alone, cut off from the outside world” situation. A life school in itself.</p>

  <p>His program came to an abrupt end in 2001 after 10 years of adventurous life: for two reasons: the coup d’état in Nepal and the subsequent ban on NGO activities, and a return to Europe for medical reasons due to a detached retina. After undergoing multiple laser surgeries, he emerged partially visually impaired, forcing him to end his career as a field adventurer, with the obligation to be resilient and to reinvent oneself. In 2003, at the age of 30.</p>

  <p>After more than a decade spent abroad in extreme operations and expeditions, he changed career paths, he resumed his original name for respect to his familial roots, and redirected his energy into cultural creation — a domain where he would preserve his adventurer’s spirit by moving fluidly between genres, privileging lived experience and innovation.</p>

  <p>The decade of one’s twenties is typically a period of initiatory formation, whether academic or self-taught. This formative stage provides the foundation that often determines the course of an individual’s later trajectory. In this case, the imprint was that of a human adventure in the field, undertaken autodidactically in distant parts of the world. It was marked by encounters with cultures beyond his native background—learning their codes, rituals, and traditions, and engaging with the diverse ways of approaching existence, the multiple cultural sensibilities that, from an ethnographic perspective, constitute the human mosaic.</p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note on the Genealogical Section:</span> This detailed genealogical section is included not for personal or promotional purposes, but to document a required familial anchor for the creator's philanthropic activities. Parallel to his personal multidisciplinary creative work, S.D. is involved in cultural diplomacy within the 'Circolo Oriundi Italiani di Parigi'—a circle founded in 1861 during the creation of the united kingdom of Italy in Turin by Piedmontese in diaspora in Paris. The circle's mission, which includes the duty of memory for their ancestors, the preservation of past and present cultural heritage for the future generations, the mutual aid for Italian expatriates in Paris and French people in Italy, and current Franco-Italian synergy, traditionally requires its active members to demonstrate a lineage, with ancestors married in a Cathedral before 1720, authenticated for nobility in the *Blasonario Subalpino*, making this genealogical data a prerequisite for legitimacy in this work, apolitical and purely in mediation, of public interest.

  <p>Family origins, from the Italian Piedmont (Cuneo and Turin) and County of Nice - diaspora in Paris since 1889. He is descended from the Piemontese Italian House of "FRANCHI da Ceva ed La Briga" (attested in Cathedral : may 3, 1564), one of the 3 cadet branches of the House "FRANCHI da Coni" (attested in Cathedral : nov 21, 1425) ; ancestral roots from Cuneo and Turin in the Italian Piemonte. (Duchy of Savoy 1416/1713, then Piemontese Kingdom of Sardegna 1720/1861, Kingdom of united Italy 1861).</p>

  <p>In the 14-15th century, during the Renaissance, 3 cadet and cousin branches were sent, as was customary at the time, to serve as military Condottieri (capitani d'arma) in the 3 border territories: the cadet branch in the Marquisate of Ceva and then in La Briga-Tende in the County of Nice under the House of Savoy since 1388 (Franchi da Ceva ed La Briga), the cousin branches in Genova for the Republic of Genoa (de Franchi-Toso) and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in Florence (Franchi da Livorno).</p>

  <p>Their common coat of arms in the armorial bears “Di Rosso a tre corone d’oro” representing three golden crowns symbolizing the 3 branches on the 3 territories (Piemonte, Genova, Tuscany). Their motto in Latin is “Mens rationi subiecta”.</p>

        <dd>Italian Piedmontese family documented in historical nobility registers and ecclesiastical archives since 3 May 1564 at the Cathedral of Sainte-Réparate in Nice; regarded as a generational continuum and a duty of memory rooted in respect for ancestors and traditions, without any claim to title or privilege</dd>

        <dt>Occupation</dt><dd>Author, multidisciplinary creator, independent researcher</dd>
        <dt>Activity</dt>
        <dd>Developing a versatile cultural identity through the crossing and remixing of genres — reportages, narrative writing, ethnographic explorations, literature, plural contemporary arts, multimedia concepts, live happenings, digital art extended universes by AI piloting, international diplomatic mediation</dd>
        <dt>Method</dt>
        <dd>Transversal conceptual approach exploring and remixing various fields of creation in a multidimensional way — <strong>CROSSING AND SHIFTING FROM ONE GENRE TO ANOTHER, a method constituting his distinctive signature</strong></dd>
        <dt>Style</dt>
        <dd>Deliberately avoids mainstream recognition, does not participate in any social network or show business, explaining the limited number of online sources, to focus on the meaning and cultural impact of the works. This choice expresses a form of media invisibility, not archival invisibility.</dd>
        <dt>Fields since 1992</dt>
        <dd>sociology; war reports; ethnography; literature; theatre; visual arts; digital art; AI; AR-VR exhibitions; happenings; cultural diplomacy</dd>

        <dt>Core identity</dt>
        <dd>Rooted in an Italian historical nobility devoted to cultural memory and heritage, his authoring embodies a multidisciplinary creation process defined by the constant crossing of genres, a deliberate invisibility from mass exposure, a meaning-centered logic, and a long-standing vocation for diplomatic cultural mediation</dd>
