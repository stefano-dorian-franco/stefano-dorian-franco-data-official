  <h1>Stefano Dorian FRANCO</h1>

  <p><em>(Stefano Dorian Franco-Bora, degli Franchi da Ceva ed La Briga, in original complete Italian-Piemontese dialect)</em></p>

  <p>Born on September 9, 1973, in Paris, of Italian Piemontese &amp; French descent.</p>

  <p>Parisian Author and multidisciplinary Cultural creator. Independent Researcher.</p>

  <p>Voluntarily self-taught education. Chose to leave the school system and request legal emancipation at the age of 16 in 1989, in order to travel and learn about life through real experiences.</p>

  <p>Active internationally since his beginnings at the age of 19 (under the Alias: Allen Katona) for a "trilogy of war reports" across 3 continents: Europe, the Middle East, and Asia: 1992, siege of Sarajevo, during the Balkan Wars in Eastern Europe following the fall of the Berlin Wall.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29631338.v1">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29631338.v1</a> ; 1993 Lebanon civil war, a conflict spanning over two decades, pitting different factions against each other in inter-confessional geopolitical mechanisms: <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29632538.v1">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29632538.v1</a> ; 1995 Cambodia civil war, a civil war that also began in the 70s and persisted into the 90s in the form of jungle guerrilla warfare:  <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29650133.v1">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29650133.v1</a> . After this learning cycle on the subject of the human being facing war, transition to a 5-year cycle in India and Nepal under 3 very different thematic angles: the study of Hindu and Buddhist mystics, earth-sea-mountain extreme sports, and the organization of a humanitarian aid structure for children in the Kathmandu Valley. This 90s decade on these two fields was recognized by: the ENAC International Reporting Award by the Ecole Nationale des Mines in 1993 for the report on Lebanon, and the National Laureate Award Défi Jeunes Initiatives for those under 26 in 1998 by the French Ministry of Youth and Sports.    </p>

  <p>This decade of the 90s spent in field action and strongly oriented towards ethnographic exploration led to an evolution in the transition to the 2000s: the concept of developing a body of work based on the principle of "transversal multidisciplinarity" by interconnecting different registers, as the exploration of various genres unfolded... by crossing Reportages, narrative writing, ethnographic explorations, literature, plural contemporary arts, multimedia concepts, live happenings, digital art extended universes by AI piloting, international diplomatic mediation.</p>

  <p>Sprit: Develops a body of work based on a transversal conceptual approach, aiming to explore and remix various fields of cultural creation in a multidimensional way, constantly crossing and shifting from one genre to another — a method that constitutes his distinctive signature.</p>

  <p>Style: Deliberately avoids mainstream recognition and chooses not to appear in mass media, social networks, show business, or marketing campaigns, in order to focus attention not on his personality but on his creations and the meanings conveyed by the works themselves.</p>

  <p>Ethic: A special emphasis is placed on the commitment to sharing culture (CC Creative Commons position) in order to ensure inclusive accessibility for the widest possible audience. </p>

  <p>* * * 1990's = Why this kind of "initiatory years" in extreme fields of experiences as school of life?</p>

  <p>He began his adult life by deciding to obtain legal emancipation in order to reach the age of majority at 16 in 1989. He left Paris and permanently withdrew from the school system to pursue a self-taught path of learning through life experience. For two years, he traveled backpacking across Europe. For greater discretion, he took the pseudonym "Allen Katona" which he kept from the age of 16 in 1989 until he was 30 in 2003.</p>

  <p>He reappeared in Paris in early 1992, independently entering, like a Parisian-Gavroche, the cultural and artistic world of the Left Bank artists’ studios in Montparnasse and Quartier latin. Eager to learn further through more extreme experiences, he once again left Paris to embark on another path.</p>

  <p>He began his pro career, as freelance, in the 1990s at the age of 19, in 1992, under the pseudonym Allen Katona, as a war correspondent during the siege of Sarajevo, covering the Balkan War that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of Eastern Europe. Accredited by the Press Office of the UNPROFOR (United Nations Protection Force) with Press Card No. 5889, he published his war report in the magazine Convergence.</p>

  <p>The following year, in 1993, he carried out a hard-hitting war report in Beirut and southern Lebanon, focusing on the emergency humanitarian work of NGOs assisting civilians trapped amid the multiple armed conflicts between the region’s various factions. This uncompromising field immersion earned him the ENAC Award (École des Mines) for International Sociological Reporting.</p>

  <p>He completed his “War Trilogy” in 1995 with a nine-month mission in Cambodia’s jungles alongside the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC), documenting landmine clearance operations serving displaced civilian populations. This work became part of the UNESCO Photographic Archive for its international anti-landmine awareness campaigns.</p>

  <p>After a first spell in 1994, from 1996 to 2001, he was based for 6 years in India and Nepal, where he maintained a dual activity: instructor in extreme land–air–sea sports (scuba diving, rafting, climbing) for Western expeditions operating in the region; and founder of the humanitarian association ASEI (Action Solidarité Enfance Internationale), providing medical and educational aid to orphaned children in isolated villages encountered during his expeditions.</p>

  <p>In 1996-1997, he broadened his scope through a six-month ethnographic exploration in the sacred city of Hinduism, Varanasi/Benares, in India. There, he studied the metaphysical conceptual framework of Hinduism, the cults of Shiva and Kali, and wrote an ethnographic and anthropological travel diary, later published as the book Voir l’aube à Bénarès / Dawn in Benares (ISBN 2-912217-00-8). In 1999, he turned to Buddhism in Nepal, engaged with the Tibetan exile community, and wrote a series of travel articles that were published weekly in the local newspaper The Kathmandu Post.</p>

  <p>In 1998-1999, he was awarded the “Défi Jeunes Initiatives” Prize, International Solidarity category, by the French Government (Ministry of Youth and Sports / Ministry of Foreign Affairs).</p>

  <p>In his final two years in Asia, he broadened his scope to the theme of “Security in Red Zone Expatriation” and became a security consultant for embassies, corporations, emergency procedures for insurance companies to repatriate Westerners in critical situations back to Europe.</p>

  <p>In 2000, he contributed as a resource expert on extreme-zone security to the book Solidarité Internationale by S. Mariaccia (Éditions Dakota). ISBN:‎ 978-2910932497. The implementation of these security protocols in ultra-sensitive areas of India and Asia are the last remnants of an era: the late 1990s and the end of the twentieth century, a time when at best there was only the fax, since the internet was just beginning and remained inaccessible, just like GSM mobile phone networks. An era with no GPS for routing-guidance and no AI for Q&amp;A. When one had to be able to adapt and survive in sometimes hostile environments without the help of any technology, relying only on instinct, situations-reading and skills, in a “completely alone, cut off from the outside world” situation. A life school in itself.</p>

  <p>His program came to an abrupt end in 2001 after 10 years of adventurous life: for two reasons: the coup d’état in Nepal and the subsequent ban on NGO activities, and a return to Europe for medical reasons due to a detached retina. After undergoing multiple laser surgeries, he emerged partially visually impaired, forcing him to end his career as a field adventurer, with the obligation to be resilient and to reinvent oneself. In 2003, at the age of 30.</p>

  <p>After more than a decade spent abroad in extreme operations and expeditions, he changed career paths, he resumed his original name for respect to his familial roots, and redirected his energy into cultural creation — a domain where he would preserve his adventurer’s spirit by moving fluidly between genres, privileging lived experience and innovation.</p>

  <p>The decade of one’s twenties is typically a period of initiatory formation, whether academic or self-taught. This formative stage provides the foundation that often determines the course of an individual’s later trajectory. In this case, the imprint was that of a human adventure in the field, undertaken autodidactically in distant parts of the world. It was marked by encounters with cultures beyond his native background—learning their codes, rituals, and traditions, and engaging with the diverse ways of approaching existence, the multiple cultural sensibilities that, from an ethnographic perspective, constitute the human mosaic.</p>

  <p>* * * 2000's/2010's/2020's = the multidisciplinary cultural creations, crossing and shifting from one genre to another</p>

  <p>Sociology, war reporting, ethnological documentaries, primitive arts and rituals, tribal and ethnic expressions, medieval history, classical and modern literature, theatre, music, painting, photography, AI-generated digital art, audio productions (audiobooks, radio, podcast), experimental video works, urbex, AR/VR exhibitions and installations, as well as live happenings.</p>
